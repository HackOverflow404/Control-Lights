# LED Strip Controller with Flask and Raspberry Pi

This project replaces a lost IR remote for an LED light strip with a modern, smart solution. Using a Raspberry Pi, a few MOSFET transistors, and a Flask web application, the LED strip can now be controlled directly from a smartphone via a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Smart LED Control**: Adjust the brightness and color of your LED strip via your phone.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A lightweight web server hosted on the Raspberry Pi allows for real-time LED control.
- **Simple Circuit Design**: Utilizes MOSFET transistors for reliable control of the LED strip.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins and Wi-Fi capabilities)
- LED light strip (RGB or single color)
- MOSFET transistors (e.g., IRF540N or similar)
- Resistors (to protect the GPIO pins)
- Power supply compatible with the LED strip
- Breadboard and jumper wires (for prototyping)

### Software

- Python 3
- Flask
- Raspberry Pi OS (Lite or Desktop)

## Circuit Design

The circuit connects the LED strip to the Raspberry Pi through MOSFET transistors:

1. The **positive terminal** of the LED strip connects to the power supply.
2. The **negative terminal** (or control terminals for RGB) connects to the drain of each MOSFET.
3. The **source** of each MOSFET connects to the ground.
4. The **gate** of each MOSFET connects to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi via a resistor.

Ensure proper connections and double-check the specifications of your MOSFETs to avoid overheating or damage.

## Installation

### 1. Set Up the Raspberry Pi

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS onto an SD card.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi and enable SSH.
3. Update the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

1. Install Python and pip:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
   ```
2. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip3 install flask
   ```

### 3. Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/led-strip-controller.git
cd led-strip-controller
```

### 4. Run the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash

   python3 app.py
   ```
2. Open a browser on your phone or computer and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the web interface using your phone or any device connected to the same network.
2. Use the sliders and buttons to adjust the LED stripâ€™s color and brightness.

## Customization

- **GPIO Pin Configuration**: Modify the `config.py` file to change which GPIO pins control the LED channels.
- **UI**: Customize the HTML/CSS files in the `templates` and `static` folders to enhance the web interface.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for animations and effects (e.g., breathing, fading).
- Integrate with smart home systems like Alexa, Google Home, or Home Assistant.
- Separating the functionality of the LED into an ESP32 to use as an MQTT client and the Raspberry Pi as a MQTT Broker
